The variety of steamers available in the market, from handheld models to more advanced, larger-capacity units, also contributes to the growing adoption among residential consumers. </p><h3>Key Trends in the Market</h3><p>The Asia-Pacific wallpaper steamer market is currently witnessing a few key trends that are shaping the direction of the industry. One prominent trend is the growing preference for eco-friendly and non-toxic methods for home improvement tasks, such as wallpaper removal.

Additionally, technological advancements have made these tools more user-friendly, with features such as ergonomic designs, adjustable steam levels, and faster heat-up times. Another important trend is the increased popularity of DIY home improvement projects, particularly in urban areas, where space and time constraints drive homeowners to adopt efficient and convenient solutions.

Additionally, businesses in the hospitality, retail, and commercial office sectors represent another key growth opportunity for the wallpaper steamer market. With continuous remodeling efforts across these sectors, commercial-grade wallpaper steamers with enhanced performance and durability are in high demand. Another opportunity for manufacturers is expanding their product range to include steamers with innovative features such as multi-functionality, where the steamers can also serve as cleaning devices for other surfaces beyond wallpaper.
